# Colored Links

## DEVELOPMENT IS ON HIATUS
There is no API for Graph View in Obsidian. Until the devs implement one, the links will remain dull and lifeless :(

This is a WIP community plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

This plugin:
- Allows you to color links in Graph View
- Set custom colors by Heading type

THIS PLUGIN IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
